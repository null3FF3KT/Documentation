hgTut is a tutorial for getting started with HuggingFace pipelines.  It was written while I was still on Windows.  The tell tale sign should be the .exe extensions, but if you're on Linux and can't figure out what's wrong, send me a message, and I'll explain some of the differences, though I'm imagining that if you're on Linux, you don't need your hand held that often.  Still, the offer is out there if I can be of help, I'm willing.  If it becomes a regular thing, I'll just start charging for the time.
